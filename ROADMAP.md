#Roadmap

#open-innovation-lab an online repository of problems and solutions
Our efforts to find solutions to global problems in economy, politics, education, environment, etc often result in closed plans of action in which not everyone can fit in. Open systems give us the opportunity to rethink how to start a conversation about a problem, how to manage it, and to be able to define and redefine a solution. There is a social component that is important for a change to be accepted, but it depends on ourselves as individuals and our own introspective conversation if it will happen or not. Once this reflection is made, we instantly take part in the real change, where paradigms are modified and accepted.
