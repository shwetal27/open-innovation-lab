The 'Open Innovation Labs' installation is the metaphorical experience of how an individual dialogue with yourself joins everyone else's thoughts, transforming into an infinite collaborative action based on the global values of open culture. The Open Innovation Labs website is the digital realization of the same: an open database on the problems, solutions and the connections between them.

This is a reminder that by existing and living on this planet you agree to have an impact on it, and this means that you are an influential factor regarding the existence of plants, animals, buildings, weapons, songs, rivers, poems, cars, computers, cakes, tattoos, castles, ships and people. We also remind you, that everything you do has an impact on something: you have no right to be neutral. Keep in mind that it's not only  your immediate environment that's affected by you, but the whole planet, the whole universe and not only the present but the future too. We hope you acknowledge this and treat it with responsibility, creativity and joy.
