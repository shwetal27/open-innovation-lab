Working open smashes barriers, 
Boulders shattered in magic transparency. 
Sharing ideas with collective solutions 
creates a majesty of empathy 
and discussing them improves gaia. 
A skill exchange is an expression of social economy 
and the internet makes global friendships possible. 
Removing negative political forces 
creates a unity of common humanity. 
Teaching positive innovation 
creates a world where ideas themselves 
are renewable. 
A global internet infrastructure 
helps ideas to be divinely disseminated. 
Could shining a light on the Polar Icecaps 
reflect the global reality of local responsibility 
we are all citizens of earth.
Isolation is still possible 
and one can be disconnected from a hyper-connected world. 
Making connections is the highest purpose of mankind. 
Global conflicts need a global solution: 
We are all Yemen, 
We are all Syria, 
We are all... 
human. 
Increasing opportunities 
and enhancing industries 
creates a healthy economy - 
one built on the intrinsic value 
of our collective consciousness, 
educating us in the symmetry 
in prospects worldwide. 
Heal the world with technology 
and create an environment safe for all 
to fulfil their ultimate potential, 
the modus operandi of our open evolution.
