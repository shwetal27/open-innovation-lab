#Project Vision

Our efforts to find solutions to global problems in economy, politics, education, enviornment often result in closed plans of action in which  not everyone can fit in. Open systems give us the opportunity to rethink how to start a conversatipn about a problem, how to manage it, and be able to define and redefine a solution.
The vision of this project is to have a digital database of the the human mind in terms of the problems everyone faces and defining solutions to those problems.
